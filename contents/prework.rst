Prework
*******
Before starting the training, there are a number of things you need to do
to prepare your work environment.

Editor/IDE
==========
We'll not use any IDE (Integrated Development Environment) but just a simple editor
that is VIM.

Install Django
==============
This training assume you're using Ubuntu OS where Python already pre-installed. So
the only thing left to do is to get Django somehow available to be used for our
exercised going forward.
